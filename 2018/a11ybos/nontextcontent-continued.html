		<h3>Exceptions to Non-Text Content</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Test<dd>If the alt text would invalidate the purpose of the test, then the text alternative should describe the purpose.
				<dt>Sensory<dd>If you have content that creates a <strong>specific sensory experience</strong> then alt text needs to provide a descriptive identification of the content.
				<dt>CAPTCHA<dd>alt text must say that its a CAPTCHA and alternative CAPTCHAs for different senses must be provided
				<dt>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible<dd>If the content is purely decorative, used for visual formatting, or not presented to users, it must be ignored by assistive technology. (i.e. It <strong>should not</strong> have a text alternative)
