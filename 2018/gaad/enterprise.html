		<h2>A11y Tools</h2>
		<h1>Enterprise Scanning Tools</h1>
      <p>Not going to discuss a specific tool</p>
      <p>I've used or interacted with the following tools to some extent...but it's been at least a year</p>
      <ul>
        <li>WorldSpace Comply (Deque)
        <li>AMP (Level Access)
        <li>Siteimprove
        <li>Rational Policy Tester (IBM)
      </ul>
    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <h3>Crawling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start at a page, crawl based on site/subsite patterns
        <li>Work best for pages not behind authentication
        <li>Work okay for pages behind authentication, but don't seem to always work
        <li>Not great for flows
      </ul>
    <h3>Usefulness of Issues Found</h3>
        <li>Can find <strong>a lot</strong> of issues
        <li>Can also find <strong>too many</strong> issues
        <li>If you fix most issues, high scores can be misleading
      </ul>
