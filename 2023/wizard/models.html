		<p>There are a few ways to look at accessibility</p>
    <h2>Medical Model of Disability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Focuses on the disability; not the person
        <li>A disability is something "wrong" with the person
      </ul>
    <h2>Social Model of Disability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Is not something wrong with a person
        <li>Disability is a mismatch between a person's needs and their environment
          <ul>
            <li>Steps
            <li>Darkened room
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
