    <h2>Aarron Walter's Hierarchy of User Needs</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Functional - people find the purpose of the product useful
        <li>Reliable - the product works as expected
        <li>Usable - the interface is refined to what the user needs 
        <li>Pleasurable - good use of pretty stuff
      </ol>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/theory-user-delight/">A Theory of User Delight</a> by the Nielson Norman Group</p>

    <h2>Reliability includes accessibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Does it work for all of our user's needs?
        <li>...or just some of our user's needs?
      </ul>
