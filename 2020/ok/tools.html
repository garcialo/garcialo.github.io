    <h2>The good and the bad</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Work well for static, public-facing pages
        <ul>
          <li>if you have a lot of public sites or subsites there may be a place for one in your strategy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Not as good for testing...
        <ul>
          <li>flows</li>
          <li>pages behind login</li>
          <li>internal-only pages</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Some tools give you a score</li>
      <li>Can be pricey
        <ul>
          <li>less than a full-time employee</li>
          <li>you will need someone to maintain it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Maintaining awareness for accessibility</li>
    </ul>
