    <h2>Strategy we used at The University of Texas at Austin</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, the biggest benefit was maintaining awareness for accessibility
      <ul>
        <li>organized scans by Educational and Administrative units
        <li>identified points of contact in each unit
        <li>established a target score
        <li>scanned monthly
        <li>monthly: reported scores to points of contact
          <ul>
            <li>reach out to teams with low scores
            <li>reach out to teams whose scores suddenly dropped
            <li>help raise score before next reporting period
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>every other month: reported scores to unit leadership (Deans, VPs, etc.)
      </ul>
