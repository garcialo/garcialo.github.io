		<h1>Accessibility Tools Presentation</h1>
		<h2>Analysis Method</h2>
		<h3>What to Look At?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Based on WCAG 2.0
				<li>Looking at Success Criteria that can be found by automated tools
				<li>Examine Bad Examples of Accessibility
				<li>Objective Features of Each Tool
			</ul>
		<h3>Which Rules to Check?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>For which Success Criteria does each Tool have at least one test?
				<li>Which tools uniquely check for which Success Criteria?
				<li>What percentage of Success Criteria are checked by each tool?
			</ul>
			<p>Summarized Information in an <a href="/tools/toolsdata.html">Automated Tools Data Page</a></p>
		<h3>Examples of Bad Accessibility</h3>
			<p>Some examples found...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>WCAG Failure Techniques
				<li>"Bad Examples" in Accessibility Developer Tool documentation
			</ul>
			<p>...but they're unrendered.</p>
			<p>Created <a href="http://www.a11ynot.com">a11yNot</a> site to render Bad Examples and track which tools catch which Bad Examples.</p>
		<h3>Problems with Analysis Method</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Mapping of checks to Success Criteria may be innacurate/incomplete
				<li>Many WCAG Failure Techniques can only be found by manual check
				<li>Bad Examples might not have been implemented correctly
				<li>Bad Examples might not actually be bad; haven't all been manually verified
				<li>Bad Examples are not comprehensive for all checks for each tool
				<li>Documentation of which tools find which issues might not be accurate
			</ul>
