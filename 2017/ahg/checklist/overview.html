		<h1>How much accessibility testing do I really need to do?</h1>
		<h2>Long Story Short</h2>
      <p>I've created an <a href="http://checklist.garcialo.com">Accessibility Audit Checklist (http://checklist.garcialo.com)</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Still work in progress (everything can and probably will change)
        <li>WCAG 2.0 Level AA
        <li>Includes coverage for the automated testing tools I use most often
        <li>Will hopefully get it on Github soon; the above URL will still work
      </ul>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>First the good stuff, then the boring stuff.
