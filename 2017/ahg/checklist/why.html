		<h1>How much accessibility testing do I really need to do?</h1>
		<h2>Why a Checklist?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wanted a checklist while working at The University of Texas at Austin
        <li>Didn't have to make one when I moved into accessibility consulting
        <li>Needing to create a roadmap for <a href="https://ebay.gitbooks.io/oatmeal/content/">OATMEAL</a>
        <li>Similar checklists exist, but internally; unaware of equivalent public checklists
        <li>Want to make accesibility testing more procedurally and financially accessible
      </ul>
