      <h3>Single-page Testing: Browser Extensions, Bookmarklets, and Websites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Typically free and open source
          <li>Critical for performing an accessibility audit
          <li>Can more easily provide context of where an issue is occuring
        </ul>
      <h3>Enterprise Accessibility Scanning Tools</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Typically expensive and proprietary
          <li>Useful for static pages
          <li>Have issues when testing flows
          <li>Don't always provide context of where an issue is occuring
          <li>Largest benefit isn't in assessing site and fixing issues
          <li>Largest benefit is in using it to keep up awareness
        </ul>
