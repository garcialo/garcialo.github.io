		<h1>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Ignore WCAG</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html#sensoryexpdef">1.1.1 Non-text Content (A) Continued</a></h2>
		<h3>Exceptions to Non-Text Content</h3>
			<p>Less "exceptions" and more slight variations of alternative text.
			<dl>
				<dt>Controls, Inputs<dd>should have NAMES instead
				<dt>Time-based Media<dd>text alternative doesn't need to serve an <strong>equivalent purpose</strong>; instead it just needs to provide a descriptive identification of the media. See Media-related Success Criteria for more information.
				<dt>Test<dd>If the alt text would invalidate the purpose of the test, then the text alternative should describe the purpose.
				<dt>Sensory<dd>If you have content that creates a <strong>specific sensory experience</strong> then alt text needs to provide a descriptive identification of the content.
				<dt>CAPTCHA<dd>alt text must say that its a CAPTCHA and alternative CAPTCHAS for different senses must be provided
				<dt>Decoration, Formatting, Invisible<dd>If the content is purely decorative, used for visual formatting, or not presented to users, it must be ignored by assistive technology.
