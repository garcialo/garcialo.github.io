    <h2>What are they?</h2>
    <p>Focus order is the order that the user will tab through interactive elements. The focus order will match the content order, except for very rare edge cases.</p>
    <p>The content order is for everything else. Will talk about this more in the next section.

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They create the paths for your keyboard and blind screen reader users
      <li>Sighted keyboard users <b>perceive</b> the page in <b>two dimensions</b>, but <b>interact</b> with it <b>linearly</b>
      <li>Screen readers users <b>perceive</b> the page <strong>and</strong> <b>interact</b> with it <b>linearly</b>
    </ul>
