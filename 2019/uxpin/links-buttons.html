    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Links take the user to another place</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Another page
      <li>Another place on the same page
      <li>You can open a link in a new tab
    </ul>
    <p>Buttons perform an action on the page</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open a flyout, modal, etc.
      <li>Manipulate content on the page (e.g. "equals" on a calculator)
      <li><b>Exception</b>: Form submit buttons can take the user to another page
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Screen readers announce whether something is a Link or Button
      <li>They have unique and different functionality
      <li>They aren't the same thing
    </ul>
