<p style="background-color:white;">Is a color difference between <span style="color:purple; text-decoration:underline">a visited link</span> and <span style="color:#204090; text-decoration:underline">an unvisited link</span> a failure of Use of Color?</p>

<p><b>From Non-text Contrast</b>:</p>
<blockquote>there is not a new requirement that visited links contrast with the default color</blockquote>

<p><b>Also from Non-text Contrast</b>:</p>
<blockquote>does not require that changes in color that differentiate between states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio <strong>when they do not appear next to each other</strong></blockquote>

<p>Does it need to meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do appear next to each other? If so, how much is "next to each other?"
