<p>What if I have various states for my switches next to each other?</p>

From <a href="https://materialdoc.com/components/selection-controls/#switch">Google Material Design documentation</a>
<img width="500px" src="https://materialdoc.com/images/switch-intro-v1.png" alt="Google Material Design switches enabled and disabled in the on and off positions">  

<p>What do I need to differentiate?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both parts of the switch are required to identify the component and need contrast
  <li>On and Off is designated by position
  <li>Does it need contrast between <strong>enabled on</strong> and <strong>disabled on</strong>?<ul><li>This example doesn't have 3.1, but "on" states are typically not grey</li></ul></li>
  <li>What about <strong>enabled off</strong> and <strong>disabled off</strong>?<ul><li>This also fails, off states are usually different kinds of grey</li></ul></li>
</ul>
