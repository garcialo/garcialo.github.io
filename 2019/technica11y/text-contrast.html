<p>Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, with some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Large text can have a 3:1 contrast
  <li>"Inactive" UI components
  <li>Decorative, invisible, and incidental texts are exempt
  <li>Logos are exempt
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> No contrast maximums are defined. Reading black on white text can cause pain for some people with dyslexia</p>
<p><b>Another note:</b> Don't neglect your image alt text
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/garcialo/pen/ObxKPY">Yes, you can style alt text</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Text contrast clarifications</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Having <strong>much larger text</strong> doesn't mean you can go below 3:1
  <li>The logo exemption doesn't extend to brand colors
  <li>Low contrast is often used as an affordance for disabled content
  <li>The SC says "inactive" but its equivalent to being disabled in HTML or "unavailable for user interaction"
</ul>
