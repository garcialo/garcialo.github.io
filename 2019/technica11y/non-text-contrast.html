<ul>
  <li>Text in UI components and graphics remains text<ul><li>logos still exempt</li></ul></li>
  <li>Does not always require component boundaries to meet the contrast minimums
  <li>Does not always compare the contrast between the component or graphic to its background
  <li>Does not require different states of the same component to contrast<ul><li>...unless they're next to each other</li></ul></li>
</ul>

    <ul>
      <li>What is required to identify the component and its state
      <li>The part or parts of the graphic that are important to understand the content
    </ul>
