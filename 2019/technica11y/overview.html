	<p>For the last few years I've given a talk exploring the exceptions to WCAG Success Criteria. While covering color-related success criteria, I show these examples:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><p style="background-color:white;color:#000000;">Somewhere in this <a style="color:#0000ff; text-decoration:none; background-color:white;" onfocus="this.style.textDecoration = 'underline'" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration = 'underline'" onblur="this.style.textDecoration = 'none'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration = 'none'" href="">sentence</a> is a link that fails 1.4.1.</li>
    <li><p style="background-color:white;color:#000000;">Somewhere in this <a style="color:#665367; text-decoration:none; background-color:white;" onfocus="this.style.textDecoration = 'underline'" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration = 'underline'" onblur="this.style.textDecoration = 'none'" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration = 'none'" href="">sentence</a> is a link that passes 1.4.1.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I would also sometimes say things like...</p>
	<ul>
    <li>I kind of hate the color alone SC
    <li>The color contrast algorithm doesn't always work...but it's what we have
    <li>The only difference between nothing and text is color in the shape of letters
    <li>I'm going to make a talk about how much I hate the "color alone guideline"
	</ul>
  <p>I've also encountered many things from wonderful people that try to meet the letter of WCAG, but not necessarily the spirit</p>
	<p>This is not a talk about gotchas when using color and how to get over them</p>
	<p>Think of it as more of a warning of some things people might want to try to get away with so you can be prepared to say "no."</p>
	<p>But before I get started, I have some bad news and some good news</p>
