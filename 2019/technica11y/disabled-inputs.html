<p>The enabled input meets the contrast minimums. The disabled input is exempt.</p>

<h3>Enabled</h3>
<label for="enabled-input" style="color:#6c6c6c;">Enabled Text Input</label>
<input type="text" id="enabled-input">

<h3>Disabled</h3>
<label for="disabled-input" style="color:#8b8b8b;">Disabled Text Input</label>
<input type="text" id="disabled-input" style="border:1px solid #8b8b8b;" disabled>

<p>If the enabled input was just above the contrast minimum and the disabled input was just below the contrast minimum, would it fail Use of Color?</p>

<p>A lot of forms will have inputs next to each other in both states</p>
